# Pointless Waymarks CMS

This project is not currently intended for general use - it is made public under an MIT license to share with friends, colleagues and anyone who finds the code interesting or useful.

Pointless Waymarks CMS is a .NET Core 5 Windows WPF GUI for generating a static website based on database information and a settings file. It is not an 'all purpose static site generation solution' - the focus is a limited set of content types to support creating long-lasting free content about the landscape, place, photography, nature, history...

[Pointless Waymarks](https://PointlessWaymarks.com) is generated with the Pointless Waymarks CMS and is a good example of both the output and intent. The inspiration for this code is the joy that creating content about the landscape has brought to my life - and the realization that for personal content I no longer care about search rankings or page views, just about creation.

Some details:
 - A static site because it is currently one of the lowest cost, lowest maintenance, most durable ways to put content online.
 - Database driven to offer flexibility in creating and updating content and to potentially support the generation of multiple output formats.
 - Custom software rather than a generic cms/web framework to optimize support for a limited set of content types - with a limited scope I believe creating custom software is likely to produce better results than adapting existing software.
 - Desktop creation software because it is an excellent way to create zero cost software. WPF because I largely work in Windows, it is my favorite Windows GUI technology atm and because the experimentation/learning/coding I do here flows back into my day job where I help to create and maintain an Inventory Management and Reporting system that has a WPF Front End.
 - A focus on 'content' and simple functional presentation

Todo Lists, Idea Lists and a Development Log are [found in a DevNotes.md file that is versioned along with the code](PointlessWaymarksCmsContentEditor/DevNotes.md).

## Application Screen Shots

### Launch Screen

Options to launch recent projects or create a new project.

### Content Lists

Each Content Type has a list interface - these are all similar with sorting, filtering and access to Excel Export/Import. The ability to export to Excel, edit and import the changes is provided for all content types and most fields. Many updates are more easily made in the program but Excel provides a powerful interface for complicated/bulk edits.

The Photo List items have buttons to quickly find other similiar photos based on details such as Camera Make, Lens, Aperture, Shutter Speed, etc. Not shown but available in the Photo List under the Reports menu are reports on photos with potential problems such as No Tags or Blank License and an option to export all of a photo's 'raw' metadata to an html file.
From the Photo List you can import photos in bulk - where possible the program will use the Photo's Metadata to generate an entry and in many cases it can create and save Photo Content without any additional data entry.

### Content Editors

The content editors are intended to be simple, helpful and functional. Change and validation indicators, previews and help with common editing actions are provided. Spatial types - Points, Lines and GeoJson have leaflet based previews.

### Tags

Tags are a primary way of connecting content - a Tag Editor along with Excel Export/Import provide support for organizing/correcting/updating tags.

### Menu Links

Content is the focus of the project and admin/widget/header/menu options are kept as minimal as possible - but some options are needed such as a very simple menu editor [Pointless Waymarks](https://PointlessWaymarks.com).

### File Change Tracking

Deploying the site is simply a matter of syncing the content from the generated local site to its destination. To help with that process the program tracks written files and has options to export the files, create very basic S3 cli scripts or use the simple built in S3 uploader.
