# Pointless Waymarks CMS

This project is not truly intended for 'general public' use - it is made public under an MIT license both to share with friends and in case any of the code is useful to anyone.

This project is a .NET Core Windows WPF GUI for generating a static website based on database information and a settings file. This software is currently being used to create https://PointlessWaymarks.com. It is not intended to be a starting point for 'general static site generation software' - it is designed instead to support the creation and generation of a very specific set of content types that I am currently interested in.

Because this is a personal project without commercial goals it may be useful to understand that after many years of creating and having personal content online my only current motivation is to create long-lasting beautiful free content with love - creating content has brought me incredible joy, popularity and having front page search results have not added any measurable happiness to my life.

Details behind this software:
 - Static Files because I believe that this is currently the lowest cost, least maintenance, most durable way to put free content online.
 - Generated and database driven because it offers a huge amount of flexibility in updating and creating content and leaves open the possibility of generating different formats.
 - Custom software because I believe I will be working with the same content types over and over again and after years of creating content in 'generic' editors I now want highly specialized no compromise ways to create exactly what I want.
 - Custom software because I believe that my goals are fundamentally simple enough that I can create new software that brings me joy with less effort and time than it would take to customize existing software.
 - I hope to write high quality code and I am happy to share it - but for various reason, including the incredibly narrow and personal focus of this project, I don't currently intend to make 'public use' a consideration
