# Pointless Waymarks CMS

This project is not currently intended for general use - it is made public under an MIT license to share with friends, colleagues and anyone who finds the code interesting or useful.

Pointless Waymarks CMS is a .NET Core 5 Windows WPF GUI for generating a static website based on database information and a settings file. It is not intended as an 'all purpose static site generation solution' and only supports the creation of a limited set of content types with a focus on long-lasting free content about landscape, place, photography, nature, history, creativity...

[Pointless Waymarks](https://PointlessWaymarks.com) is generated with the Pointless Waymarks CMS and is a good example of the output and intent. The inspiration for this code is the incredible richness and joy that creating content about the landscape has added to my life. The direction of the project is driven by my love of authentic content and informed by many years spent learning the deep value of creating personal content with great care but without the need for SEO, First Page Search Results, Engagement Numbers, Advertising or Tracking...

Details behind this software:
 - A static site because it is currently one of the lowest cost, lowest maintenance, most durable ways to put content online.
 - Database driven to offer flexibility in creating and updating content and to potentially support the generation of multiple formats.
 - Custom software rather than a generic cms/web framework so that the limited content types I want to create can be specifically and well supported - with a limited scope I believe I can create more useful software in less time by coding something new/specific rather than customizing an existing system.
 - Desktop creation software because it is an excellent way to create zero cost software. WPF because I largely work in Windows, it is my favorite Windows GUI technology atm and because the experimentation/learning/coding I do here flows back into my job where I help to create and maintain an Inventory Management and Reporting system that has a WPF Front End.
 - A focus on 'content' with a simple and beautiful presentation

### Application Screen Shots

Launch screen with quick and easy options to launch recent projects or create a new project.

Each Content Type has a list interface - these are all similar with sorting, filtering and access to Excel Export/Import. The ability to export to Excel, edit and import the changes is provided for all content types and most fields - many updates are more easily made in the program but Excel provides a powerful interface for complicated/bulk edits.

The Photo List items have buttons to quickly find other photos based on details such as Camera Make, Lens, Aperture, Shutter Speed, etc. Not shown but available in the Photo List under the Reports menu are reports on photos with potential problems such as No Tags or Blank License and an option to export all of a photo's 'raw' metadata to an html file.
From the Photo List you can import photos in bulk - where possible the program will use the Photo's Metadata to generate an entry and in many cases can create and save Photo Content without any additional data entry.

The content editors are intended to be simple, helpful and functional. Change and validation indicators, previews and help with common editing actions are provided.

Tags are a valuable way to search and categorize content and the Tag Screen provides search and display of Tags and Content. Rather than try to provide in-editor actions for bulk edits the interface relies on the Excel export/import process - while it is occasionally cumbersome using Excel to bulk edit tags the advantage is that you are not limited in what you can do...

Content is the focus of the project and admin/widget/header/menu options are kept as minimal as possible - but some options are still needed such as a very simple menu editor [Pointless Waymarks](https://PointlessWaymarks.com).
