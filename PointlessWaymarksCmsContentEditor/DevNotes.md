## Todos
 - Compact Content could use a style similar to related content for no image entries at least on mobile
 - Style link list
 - JSON Link Backup file in list directory
 - Link RSS Feed
 - RSS Feed main images when appropriate
 - Revisit og metadata - used correctly? Other tags that could be included?
 - Look at adding Dublin Core metadata to pages
 - Top of the page search box - maybe pass a query parameter to the all content list page?
 
## Ideas
 - What if you piped/setup your google alerts to RSS and there was integrated support for pulling them in and working with them. Obvious con is not sure even if RSS is still currently an option whether it will always be an option.
 - Backup the master media directory and database
 - Restore from JSON
 - Some sort of Master JSON Backup
 - Check in on the Spatialite Z bug in EF Core and/or investigate moving to SQLite (what about an elevation lookup table vs Z values?)

Added Pinboard integration via a nice wrapper I found in Nuget/GitHub - notes:
 - In addition to 'liking' Pinboard integration is included because Pinboard has a plan where a copy of the of website at the time of the link is stashed - this is important for a long lived project because it is hard to predict what links and sites are going to disappear off the web...
 - A nice part of the Pinboard API is that 'add' has a flag for replace - for this integration to keep it simple I just call Add with the replace and don't worry about whether it existed before or not
 - Rather than separate actions for saving to Pinboard or UI choices I just decided to check for a Pinboard API Token - this could cause confusion if you setup a new config and didn't realize items weren't saving but I don't think that is a major concern at this point and I just put a progress line in.

AngleSharp Notes:
 - Getting web pages thru the AngleSharp library was pleasantly easy - only hitch was that with the simple sample defaults one of the first pages I hit seemed to detect this style as 'noscript' and some of the metadata wasn't included (I am not even sure this was the intended behaviour, but regardless that was what was happening) but this was quickly fixed by including the AngleSharp.Js package and including .WithJs() - it could be this eventually causes an issue but pleasantly it didn't yet cause any issues or a long enough delay that I cared.
 - I have dealt with Open Graph metadata, and looked at other metadata, for HikeLemmon but hadn't before looked across sites for 'standard metadata' like author and publish date - at least with the sample of sites I looked at, which included many smaller news sites, it was a mess - og: data was often included (I assume in part for Facebook), some sites used https://www.dublincore.org/, some had twitter info, and some didn't have great info. I suppose I understand in terms of business, average consumer and lack of incentives - but this (plus the insane number of script tags included in basically all of these sites) makes me want to do a better job on this with this project - I feel like this data 'should' be there and consistent
