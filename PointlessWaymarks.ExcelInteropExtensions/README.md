## Excel Interop Extensions

This code was downloaded from: [Automate multiple Excel instances - CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/1157395/automate-multiple-excel-instances) - This excellent article and code by James Faix that builds on an earlier article he wrote [Get a Collection of All Running Excel Instances - CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1080611/Get-a-Collection-of-All-Running-Excel-Instances).

These articles credit [var excel = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application();excel.Workbooks.Op - Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/F7gkrAST) which both credit Andrew Whitechapel's article 'Getting the Application Object in a Shimmed Automation Add-in' http://blogs.officezealot.com/whitechapel/archive/2005/04/10/4514.aspx. The post by Andrew Whitechapel post - now only available thru the Wayback Machine - [Andrew Whitechapel : Getting the Application Object in a Shimmed Automation Add-in](https://web.archive.org/web/20130518152056/http://blogs.officezealot.com/whitechapel/archive/2005/04/10/4514.aspx) - seems to be referenced in any interesting answer to the problem of getting a reference to a running Excel application and was my reference when I wrote similar code for the Summit Hut reporting and data entry applications. Amazingly the basic technique from the 2005 Whitechapel post still works on the latest versions of Excel!

This project imports and updates the 4 code files from the Excel Extensions project with minimal changes (note one method is removed because I didn't need it and it uses Marshal.GetActiveObject which is not available in .NET 5 (Core)).
